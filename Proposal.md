# Final Project Proposal

**Project URL**: TODO

For this project, we will build a machine translation visualization tutorial. We will use RNN units unfolding to get a better understanding of what is happening at each step. After that, we plan to use visualization to clearly illustrate each step and make it more interactive.

 Based on our understanding, the existing solutions on machine translation visualizations are too hardcore for people without machine learning background to understand. Existing visualizations of RNN models are either too general or hard code for machine learning beginners. Library tutorials use plots to help explain high-level concepts but treat the training process as a black box. For instance, tutorial of tf-seq2seq model created by Google (https://google.github.io/seq2seq/) includes a gif to show the idea of encode-decode process. But this simple gif neglects details like hidden states, gate, etc., therefore is not sufficient for beginners to learn the working mechanism. Besides, there are tools specifically for visualizing RNN models. For example, Seq2Se2-Vis, a visual debugging tool for sequence-to-sequence models (http://seq2seq-vis.io/) which allows interaction with a trained seq2seq model through each stage of the translation process. However, the aim of the tool is for debugging and targets experienced users. With little text and unordered plots, the tool may fail to work beginners through the model principles.

Different from existing works, we want to make our project as a tutorial or introduction where we will clearly explain what each step does in a general form and add more attractive interactions in between. Our main target customers are these people who donâ€™t know RNN before, but are interested in it. We define success in three levels: having a good seq2seq model, having effective visualizations for the seq2seq model, and having an engaging interactive tutorial. Based on our findings, many existing works focus on the effectiveness of their visualizations on RNN models or on seq2seq models and thus are usually hard for beginners or people who have limited or no prior knowledge in this field to read. If we can achieve those different levels of success, we believe that our deliverable can have a meaningful educational impact on RNN.

There are certainly some risks involved in our project. Specifically, there are no guarantees that the existing machine translation models are suitable for visualization tasks due to the complicated nature of their architectures. If this is the case, we will face the challenges of making substantial modifications on the existing models or even developing a new one, which could be highly time consuming and maybe unrealistic considering the time span of this project. However, we will carefully investigate and evaluate these risks before proceeding with our project. Also regarding how to divide our time among different tasks, we now have a high level plan. Firstly, we will conduct a careful research and literature reading on the subject matter, which will take approximately 1 week. Then the implementation of the model and data visualizations will take 2 to 3 weeks. Lastly, we will spend about 1 week to optimize and evaluate the model and of course to see how we could further improve the whole project in general and make it more interactive and interesting.
