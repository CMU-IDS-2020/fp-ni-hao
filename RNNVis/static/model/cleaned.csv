My parent will take us to go for traveling especially when school holiday is coming. A wonderful holiday that I still remember until now is when my family and I went to Tioman Island when school holiday. That was the first time and first experience I went to Tioman Island. We stayed at Tioman Resort about three days. About seven o'clock early in the morning, we took a car to go to Jeti Mersing from Kota Tinggi. Around nine in the morning, we arrived at Jeti Mersing and my father parked his car at there. We take a bot at ten o'clock. Our journey from Jetty Mersing to Tioman Island is about one hour and thirty minute. Along travel to Tioman Island by bot, I saw many interesting scenery like a lot of monkey when our bot is near to the near Island and the water was very clean and clear blue in colour. Iam the one who was very excited to arrived at Tioman Island. At twelve noon, we safely arrived at Tioman Island. I was very excited. The scenery was very amazing with the birds flying anywhere just like to welcome us. It is so fascinating to be there. When we went out from the bot, have a car exactly like when we see when people playing a golf was waiting for us to take us to the resort. Along in the car, we found a lot of monkey was climbed the trees. The driver also looked very friendly and love to tell us about Tiomal Island.

3762,"Many people take this week off from work and school to spend time with their families. The holidays are a good time to strengthen our connections and renew relationships. So turn off the cell phones, computers and televisions and take time to focus on your family.
  Research shows that families who spend time together are strong families. They communicate better and share a sense of belonging. Here are a few ideas you can try to spend time with your family.
     * Family game night. Spend at least one night during the holidays with the TV off and the family huddled together to play a favorite game. You may play cards, bingo or any other family favorite. Consider continuing this practice throughout the year and designate at least one night per week as family game night.
     * Go for a walk. After eating rich holiday foods, taking a walk provides not only time together but a great way to get some exercise.
     * Movie night. Rent a movie or watch a TV holiday special, pop some popcorn, and kick back for some family fun. Like game night, this may be something you'd like to continue throughout the year as a way to spend time together.
     * Play outdoors together. You can ride bikes, play ball, or go for a hike. Itall give the entire family some fresh air, exercise and great fun.
     * Go shopping. Hang out together while shopping at the after Christmas sales.
      * Cook together. Parents and kids can do the holiday baking and food preparation together. Even the youngest children can wash vegetables, set the table, or ice cookies.
     * Spend some one-on-one time with each child if you have more than one. Spending time alone provides time to bond with the child and helps him gain a sense of belonging and feeling of importance. It also provides an opportunity for the two of you to get to know each other better.
     * Since grandparents and older family members usually visit during the holidays, take time to share family customs and tell stories about past generations. Families build strength when they share family customs and traditions give family members a sense of belonging, and they strengthen values and beliefs. 
     One of the greatest gifts of the holiday season is the gift of time with family. Spend time together to strengthen relationships and to make wonderful family memories. Strong families spend time with each other - quality time in large quantities. So begin during the holidays and continue making time for each other throughout the year.",affection

There were the usual speeches, presentation of degrees to graduates and a few other things which the faculty had organized, and then after we organized a big lunch.

There was my own family and three of my friends and their families as well, so it was quite an occasion. We had this family lunch at a local restaurant which we had booked for the afternoon. It was a really special time having all the most important people in my life together at the same time.

Recently My sister came to India to Visit us. But For a quite while even before she visiting us, she has been suffering with few pains in her wrist. Initially she thought it was just due to workload. So When She came to India, she consulted our family Doctor . He reported after few scanning that she has Giant Bone Tumor in her hand and Some Organisms have already eaten some part of her bone. So we quickly without any further delay Planned for Operation in which some part of Necessary Bone from leg will be taken and that part will be fixed in hand after removing the tumor she had. Later they thought fixing it with artificial Bone. On the day of Operation,We all family members were waiting outside while her operation was going on. Then Came Doctor and Said they needed Blood ( B+) because of the blood loss she had during operation it was making her hard to breath. I and along with My sister's Brother-in-law Rushed to Blood Bank, I decided to be the Donor , But they initially needed to check my Blood group and all that safety measures which took around 20 Minutes and They Needed Blood Soon and I Quickly Started pumping my Blood Out and Finally Reached the hospital and handed over it to them and the Operation took Place Successfully.
Don't Know why but that feeling which I Experienced while Traveling to hospital with my Blood in my Hands to my sister in need of it and tears were rolling threw my eyes is the best feeling I ever Experienced in life.

Part of the challenge of a science of happiness is to identify different concepts of happiness, and where applicable, split them into their components. Related concepts are well-being, quality of life and flourishing.

Weare starting a new series on the Buffer blog today with great tips and insights from Joel, CEO here at Buffer. Joel will share his ideas and insights about lifehacking, building a business and working on company culture. Here is #1:
Today itas a little over three years since I first had the idea for Buffer, and with the year and a half before that which I worked on my previous startup, Iave started to notice a few patterns amongst the ups and downs that come with building a startup.
One of the most important things Iave learned during this time is that I perform the best when Iam happy. It really does change everything. If Iam happy then Iam more productive when hacking code, Iam better at answering support, and I find it easier to stay focused.
Iave found that there are a few key habits which, for me, act as great rituals for enabling me to be consistently happy. They also act as anchor activities to bring my happiness level back up quickly whenever I have a period where Iam not feeling 100%. So here are 6 of the things I do:
1. Wake up early
One of the things I love about running my own startup is that I have complete freedom to experiment with my daily routine.
Through experimentation, Iave found that waking up early every day makes me feel most invigorated and happy. It gives me a great start to the day, and this almost always leads to a great rest of the day. Over time, Iave found I crave that early morning feeling, a time I can do some great work and be super focused. Gretchen Rubin from The Happiness Project mentioned something similar a recent article:
aI get up at 6:00 a.m. every day, even on weekends and vacation, because I love it.a
Waking up early every day requires discipline, especially about what time I sleep. Right now, I have a sleep ritual of disengaging from the day at 9:30pm and sleeping at 10pm. I now love all aspects of this ritual and with it in place I awake at 6am feeling fresh.
The power with your mornings is that you will have about 25,000 of them in your life, so thereas a lot of room to experiment.
2. Exercise daily
aWe found that people who are more physically active have more pleasant-activated feelings than people who are less activea a Amanda Hyde
In the last three years, Iave gone from dabbling with exercise to it becoming something I do every weekday without fail. At first I had no idea what to do at the gym, so I asked my brother, whoas a personal trainer. I then went a few times with a good friend and soon I was hooked.
Over time, I developed this into a daily ritual so strong that I feel a pull towards it, and by doing it consistently I feel fantastic and can more easily take on other challenges. I recently discovered that exercise is a keystone habit which paves the way for growth in all other areas. Iave also found that it helps me to get high quality sleep each night.
3. Have a habit of disengagement
aThe richest, happiest and most productive lives are characterized by the ability to fully engage in the challenge at hand, but also to disengage periodically and seek renewal a Loehr and Schwarz, The Power of Full Engagement
As I mentioned earlier, a key way I am able to wake up at 6am is through my ritual of disengaging in the evening. I go for a walk at 9:30pm, along a route which Iave done many times before. Since the route is already decided and is the same every time, I am simply walking and doing nothing else. This prompts reflection and relaxation.",achievement

I felt crushed by the pressures of trying to pursue a career my family wanted from me rather than one I wanted for myself. So, I just wanted to break free from all of them and be as far away as I possibly could, even my grandma whom has been there for me every day for the first 12 years of my life.It wasn't until lately, that I realized the importance of family and how short life can be. My grandma is 96 years old, which means she has a limited time left on this beautiful planet. It made me really sad that I haven't made much effort to really spend time with her ever since she moved to her own home. Instead of spending my weekends with her, I chose to go out with friends, date around, sit at home on the computer browsing new music, and basically just waste my time.This weekend, I decided to change that. I called her and spent the entire day with her. Sunday morning, I came to her house, cooked us some pancakes (her favorite), we went to Temple, just like we did when I was a kid, and then we spent the rest of the day at the mall, browsing the stores. I didn't expect it to make me as happy as I had planned, but it really made my day. I'm really glad I did that and I certainly plan to spend a lot more time with her now.",affection

I am in some cooking mood. You have food, I will make a roti for me"". She said, ""Why will you work in kitchen while I am here?""I said, ""I want to make a roti"" and I left my seat. Sister popped up saying, ""Have this roti from mummy's plate, complete your lunch and then make a roti for mumma.""I said, ""Well! You are falling for a dangerous act.Hahahahah."" I completed my lunch and started with roti, This was it! Previously I have cooked many times, but only for me. This was the first time I cooked for mother.I made a roti and served it to mother. She made 3 parts of it, one for my sister, one for my father and one for herself. They all had their parts and I was observing them with suspense about comments.Sister chuckled, Your wife is lucky, you can feed her deliciously. Father giggled, Your Gf must have said you to learn cooking this morning.Mother was little emotional, she said, My son has grown up. Roti is sweet! She was happy.

11746,"Somehow I ended up with the best parents in the world. Iave always been grateful to have them, and I know that Iam the badass I am today in large part because of them.

Most people would consider themselves fortunate to have great parents. However, I ended up with the coolest grandparents ever, as well. My last living grandparent died more than 16 years ago, but I think of all of them often.

But I never had the opportunity to meet one of my grandparents. My dadas mom, Florence, died in 1979, six years before I was born. My grandpa George remarried shortly after my birth, and his second wife, a saintly, kind woman named Marie, became my grandma, and I loved her as much as all of my biological grandparents.

Iave often wondered about Grandma Florence though.
She was just fifty-seven years old when she died, and Iam ashamed to say that I donat remember if it was from ovarian cancer or cervical cancer. I think ovarian. Whatever the cause, she died way too young.

But just because I never met her doesnat mean that she hasnt had an impact on my life. She has probably impacted my life more than any other person who Iave never met. That might not make sense, but let me explain.

I donat remember how old I was when I learned that Grandpa George had a wife, and my dad had a mom, who Iad never met. I suspect I was six or seven-years-old, but I donat remember learning that information for the first time. It seems like something I always knew, even though Iam sure it isnat.

I remember seeing pictures of her, and once visiting her grave. My sisteras middle name is Florence, and I knew why.

The earliest impact that I recall Grandma Florence having on my life came one rainy night when I was nine or ten-years-old. My dad, my two sisters and I were in the car and joking around. I donat remember what we were talking about, but at some point the conversation turned to wishes. If we could have just one wish, what would it be?

Iam sure my sisters and I wished for common kid stuff: a million dollars, school to be canceled, a TV in my room. Real dumb stuff to waste a wish on.

And then we asked my dad what head wish for. And he said, aI wish my mom was still alive so she could meet you guys and see how proud I am of you.a

Holy cow.

The joking atmosphere in the car immediately became more somber, and I donat remember if any of us said anything. But I remember thinking to myself, aHe sure must love us if heas going to use his one wish for that.a

I knew he loved us. Despite his occasional moodiness, none of us ever questioned that we were the most important part of his life. He and my mom told us they loved us often, and that they were glad to have us. But his wish just seemed to kick things up a notch.

Since that night, whenever I think of Grandma Florence I think of that conversation in the car, and Iam reminded once again just how much my parents love us. And that never ending, unconditional love has provided so much support for me over the years that I have no doubt itas the foundation of every single positive thing I do in my life.

I think itas also the reason that I feel such a devotion to my kids and to my wife. I know how it feels to never have to wonder if anyone loves you completely and unconditionally. Iave known that all my life. And I want them to know it, also. I never want them to wonder if thereas anyone who loves them so completely.

In sixty-two days, on August 10, it will be the 100th anniversary of Grandma Florenceas birth. I donat know if anyone else has plans to celebrate it, but in my house well get an ice cream cake, and well sing Happy Birthday. And Iall tell my kids the few things I know about Grandma Florence, and Iall tell them the story of that night in the car.

And Iall do my best to make them feel as loved as I did when I heard my dadas wish.",affection

I felt crushed by the pressures of trying to pursue a career my family wanted from me rather than one I wanted for myself. So, I just wanted to break free from all of them and be as far away as I possibly could, even my grandma whom has been there for me every day for the first 12 years of my life.It wasn't until lately, that I realized the importance of family and how short life can be. My grandma is 96 years old, which means she has a limited time left on this beautiful planet. It made me really sad that I haven't made much effort to really spend time with her ever since she moved to her own home. Instead of spending my weekends with her, I chose to go out with friends, date around, sit at home on the computer browsing new music, and basically just waste my time.This weekend, I decided to change that. I called her and spent the entire day with her.

12836,"We went to my cousinas wedding. It was a lovely wedding very unlike any wedding Iave yet been to, but a lot like the weddings in the movies (you know, like The Wedding Crashersa| never understood why someone would *want* to go to a wedding they werenat invited to).  The ceremony was short and simple, though there were a lot of attendants, complete with flower girl and ring-bearer.  The bride had both her father and step-father give her away, one on each arm.  The Lutheran minister was kind of a jolly middle-aged woman.  The gentlemen were almost all in army dress uniforms.  From my cousinas face, you could not tell he was hit by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan just a few months ago.  Heas still not walking correctly and never may, but the damage seems to mainly be concentrated in one leg.

The wedding was in a part of the country where folks are not as stiff as Midwesterners or as unstructured as Northern Californians.  Iave been to Midwestern wedding receptions that tried to be like this reception, but the soul wasnat there so they always ended up being kind of lame with folks congregated in the parking lot to talk away from the DJ.  People at this wedding line-danced (and not just to country music) and they enjoyed it.  My usually introverted uncle is apparently a dancing fiend and led the bride in some traditional dances.  The food was great and full of local specialties (including something we heard about on the Splendid table from their road trip foodies).  And, important in my book for any wedding, they served appetizers between the wedding and reception.

You may recall that the groomas parents had said they refused to attend because he was not getting married by a priest.  Not only did they not show up, despite his being hit by a roadside bomb in service to our country, they did not allow any siblings to come.  The daughter whose college my parents and aunts are paying was threatened with being disowned when her mother found out she was planning to attend.  So she didnt go.  Guests kept asking if I was a sister.  No, not a sister.

But all of my aunts and uncles went, and I have a lot of aunts and uncles. It was funny to see all my uncles and my cousin and the characteristic ears of that side of the family.  The family resemblance is especially strong with military haircuts.  All my uncles are ex-military and they bonded with my cousinas army buddies.  Not much has changed in the army in the past 30-40 years.  SNAFUs still abound.  My aunts talked about how the world has changed and wondered if the homophobic father of the groom realized his favorite aunt (after whom one of his daughters is named) was a lesbian.  How nice it would have been if shead been around today and been able to share her relationship with her acompaniona out in the open.

They openly wondered what had happened to my unclea head always been rigid and never had a sense of humor, but wasnat such a hater until he married his wife.  Perhaps he could have been rigid and humorless for the powers of good if head married someone else.  Ironically, the woman he married and is refusing to countenance this wedding is a divorced mother of three| but the difference is that she got the Pope to annul that marriage, so somehow that made it ok.  There was some speculation that perhaps the bride is better off with her mother-in-law not talking to her.

My childless aunt and uncle took over duties of parents of the groom. The groom gave an especially moving speech about how grateful he was for his family to come and show the support they were showing.  The bride sent a lovely thank-you note with the same sentiments.  As the wedding party was breaking up for the folks having to catch planes, the bride and groom made plans to visit all of my aunts and uncles who live in interesting and accessible places.  My family does take care of its own, even when some members refuse to.

My cousin and his new wife are very nice people.  I know they will have a lifetime of happiness together.  And if their children and step-children are close with their great-aunts and uncles rather than their grandparents on my side of the family, well, that's not such a bad thing.",affection

I felt crushed by the pressures of trying to pursue a career my family wanted from me rather than one I wanted for myself. So, I just wanted to break free from all of them and be as far away as I possibly could, even my grandma whom has been there for me every day for the first 12 years of my life.It wasn't until lately, that I realized the importance of family and how short life can be. My grandma is 96 years old, which means she has a limited time left on this beautiful planet. It made me really sad that I haven't made much effort to really spend time with her ever since she moved to her own home. Instead of spending my weekends with her, I chose to go out with friends, date around, sit at home on the computer browsing new music, and basically just waste my time.This weekend, I decided to change that. I called her and spent the entire day with her. Sunday morning, I came to her house, cooked us some pancakes (her favorite), we went to Temple, just like we did when I was a kid, and then we spent the rest of the day at the mall, browsing the stores. I didn't expect it to make me as happy as I had planned, but it really made my day. I'm really glad I did that and I certainly plan to spend a lot more time with her now.",affection
